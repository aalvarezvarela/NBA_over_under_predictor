"""The intermediate pipeline must not change the closing-line pipeline.

Both datasets are built from the same feature functions. The intermediate one
composes them differently and adds a stricter gate on top; it must never patch,
wrap or reconfigure anything the existing pipeline depends on.

These are contract tests rather than an end-to-end comparison: building either
dataset needs database access and takes minutes, which does not belong in the
unit suite. What is checked here is every seam where a change could leak across
-- the shared entry points still existing with the signatures the new code
relies on, and importing the new pipeline leaving the old one's behaviour
untouched.
