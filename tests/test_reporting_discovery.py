"""Resolving notebook inputs into run directories.

The interesting case is mapping a campaign config folder to the runs it
produced, because run directories are named ``{experiment_name}_{timestamp}``
and a plain prefix test over-matches: ``total_points_2500`` is a prefix of
``total_points_2500_old_games_20260704_20260802_115707``, a different
experiment entirely.
