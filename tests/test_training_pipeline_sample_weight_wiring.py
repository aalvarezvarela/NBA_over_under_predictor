"""Recency weighting must be *evaluated* the same way it is later *applied*.

Two ways that can silently break, both regression-tested here:

1. Optuna samples `use_sample_weight` / `sample_weight_lambda`, but the CV fits
   that score those choices run unweighted -- so the search selects a training
   option it never actually tested, and the shipped model is fitted under a
   regime no trial measured.
2. A trial that explicitly chooses "no weighting" is represented as
   ``lambda=None``, which a downstream `None`-means-unset fallback then turns
   back into the configured lambda -- reinstating exactly what the trial
   rejected.
