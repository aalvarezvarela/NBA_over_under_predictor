"""Strategy/adapter layer resolving the asymmetry between optuna_total_points.py
and optuna_error_line.py.

Confirmed by direct inspection: optuna_total_points.py always needs `line_col`
(it pulls the betting line from X[line_col] for OU-accuracy scoring) and has
no sample-weight support at all. optuna_error_line.py never takes `line_col`
(it scores directly off the sign of the predicted error) but fully supports
recency sample-weighting (sample_weight/sample_weight_dates/
sample_weight_lambda/tune_sample_weight_lambda).

get_strategy(config) is the only branch point in this whole package -- every
other module calls strategy.<method>(...) and never imports optuna_total_points
or optuna_error_line directly.
