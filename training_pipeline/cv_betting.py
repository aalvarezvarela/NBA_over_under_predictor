"""Betting metrics across the cross-validation folds, not just the holdout.

The motivation is statistical power. At -110 the break-even win rate is 52.38%,
and a Wilson interval around a genuinely good 55% win rate does not clear that
bar until well over a thousand bets. A 5% holdout of this dataset yields ~290
candidate games and ~115 actual bets, which cannot distinguish a real edge from
a lucky one -- any ranking decided on holdout ROI alone at that volume is close
to a coin flip.

The CV folds already exist and already cover far more games: 12 folds of ~50
validation games is ~600, roughly 5x the holdout. Scoring them for profit costs
one extra fit per fold at the already-chosen hyperparameters -- about the same
as a single Optuna trial -- and turns the split that actually drives decisions
into the split with the most evidence behind it.

The honest caveat, which is why this does not replace the holdout: these folds
selected the hyperparameters, so their betting metrics are optimistically
biased. Use them to COMPARE configurations (the bias applies roughly equally to
each) and the holdout to ESTIMATE out-of-sample performance. The gap between
the two is itself informative -- a large one is the signature of selection
overfitting.
