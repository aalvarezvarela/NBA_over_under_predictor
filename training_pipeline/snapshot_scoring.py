"""Per-snapshot betting metrics for a dataset with several rows per game.

The intermediate-line dataset holds one row per (game, pre-game snapshot), so a
single game appears once at every configured horizon. One model is trained on
all of those rows, with ``TIME_TO_MATCH_MIN`` as an ordinary feature, so it can
learn how the mapping
changes with time to tip. This module is about how such a model is *scored*.

Why the scoring has to be split
-------------------------------
``evaluate_betting`` counts every row as one independent bet, and
``wilson_interval`` builds its confidence interval from that count. Handed the
pooled predictions, one game contributes several rows, so the evaluator
reports several bets for what is largely one game bet one way and counted
repeatedly. Within a game the snapshot lines differ by much less than the
typical outcome noise, so those rows are heavily correlated -- they share one
outcome.

The inflation is real but its exact size is NOT ``sqrt(N)`` for N snapshots.
That figure would hold only if every snapshot were present and produced an
identical decision. In practice horizons are missing (T=720 covers 97.6% of
games, not 100%), the
min-edge filter selects different subsets at different snapshots, and two
snapshots can even take opposite sides once the line has moved across the
model's estimate. The direction is certain and the magnitude is not, which is
why this module suppresses the pooled row's interval and significance verdict
entirely rather than printing a corrected one: an honest interval there needs
game-clustered inference, which is not implemented here.

Grouping by snapshot fixes it arithmetically: within one ``TIME_TO_MATCH_MIN``
there is exactly one row per game, so the rows really are independent events and
the binomial maths is correct again.

It also matches how the bet is actually placed. Nobody bets the same game once
per configured snapshot; they bet it once, at some hour before tip. "What is
my win rate if I
always bet 12 hours out?" is a strategy someone can run, and it is exactly the
``720`` group. A single pooled number measures a strategy nobody runs.

What this module does NOT do
----------------------------
It fits nothing. Every number here is a regrouping of predictions the pipeline
has already produced under its own walk-forward discipline -- CV folds train
strictly before their validation dates, and the daily holdout retrains once per
game-day on games played strictly before it. Re-scoring cannot introduce
look-ahead because it never trains. The decisions themselves (which side, and
whether the bet clears the edge threshold) are taken verbatim from the pooled
run, so slicing changes the grouping and nothing else.

Nothing in ``training_pipeline`` is modified by this module. It reads the
existing result object, reuses ``evaluate_betting`` unchanged, and returns
tables.

    ``n_snapshots`` is the count of distinct ``TIME_TO_MATCH_MIN`` values feeding
    this row, and it is the readable trustworthiness flag: 1 means every row is
    a different game, so ``n_bets`` really is a count of independent events.
    Anything above 1 means the same game is counted once per snapshot.

    It replaces an earlier ``rows_per_game`` column that could never be
    populated. That column needed GAME_ID, which ``advanced_column_cleaning``
    drops (its name contains "_ID") and which ``_required_keep_columns`` does
    not protect -- so it was blank in every real report while the docs told the
    reader to filter on it. Worse, "just keep GAME_ID" is not the fix: the
    default ``exclude_cols`` is only ["TOTAL_POINTS", "SEASON_YEAR",
    "GAME_DATE"], so a surviving GAME_ID would land in the feature matrix as a
    string that monotonically encodes date and sequence. It is dropped for good
    reason.

    ``n_games`` is therefore populated only when a caller genuinely has game
    identifiers (tests, or a caller working from the raw CSV). It is None in the
    normal pipeline path, and nothing in the output depends on it.

    ``is_significant`` is suppressed on any row with more than one snapshot:
    the binomial interval behind it assumes independent trials, and correlated
    per-game repeats break that assumption in the anti-conservative direction.
    Reporting a significance verdict there would be asserting something this
    module cannot support without game-clustered inference.
