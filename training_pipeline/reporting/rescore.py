"""Re-score saved runs at one common bet threshold, at read time.

Why this exists: ``betting.primary_edge_threshold`` is an experiment-config
field, so the threshold in force *when a run executed* is frozen into that
run's ``betting_metrics.json`` and therefore into the leaderboard's ``roi`` /
``win_rate`` / ``n_bets`` columns. Change the config and old runs keep
reporting at the old threshold while new ones use the new one -- and the two
land in the same column, silently comparing different measurements.

The size of that mismatch is not subtle. One run, one model:

    threshold 2.0 -> 61.6% win rate, +17.5% ROI, 87 bets
    threshold 0.0 -> 55.7% win rate,  +6.3% ROI, 416 bets

Nothing about the model changed; only which bets were counted.

Every run also saves its raw predictions, so the fix is to ignore the frozen
headline and recompute from those at whichever threshold the analysis wants,
identically for every run. Scoring goes through
``betting.evaluate_betting`` -- the same function the pipeline itself uses --
so this is a re-application of the rule, not a second implementation of it.

Thresholds are per-strategy because their units differ: regressors select on
points away from the line, classifiers on expected value. One number cannot
serve both.
