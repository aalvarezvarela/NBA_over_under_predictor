    """Add continuity, incoming, and net minute shares for two roster horizons.

    A target season's roster window begins on March 15 during the preceding NBA
    season and ends at the target game. A player enters the window when either a
    regular-season/postseason boxscore or injury report assigns them to a team.
    They count as lost only when their latest known assignment in that window is
    to another team.

    Every roster candidate is weighted by minutes played for the target team per
    target-team game in the target season, falling back to the previous season.
    Continuity is the retained candidates' share of all candidate minute value.
    Current-game boxscore rows become available on the following day;
    current-game injury reports are treated as before-game information.

    The immediate version normally uses the two calendar months before the game.
    If that start falls from June through September, it moves to March 1 to span
    the offseason and retain a usable pre-summer roster baseline.

    Incoming players are those whose latest assignment is the target team and
    whose preceding distinct assignment inside the window was another team.
    Their value is their average minutes for that previous team, divided by 240.

    Net roster minutes are incoming share minus lost share. Since lost share is
    ``1 - continuity``, the equivalent calculation is
    ``incoming share + continuity - 1``. Positive values mean more minutes were
    brought in than lost; negative values mean the opposite.
