"""Center asymmetrically priced snapshot quotes onto a -110/-110 equivalent.

Why this exists at all: a book can move its *price* without moving its *line*,
so two quotes of "224.5" priced -105/-115 and -120/+100 are not the same market
view. Comparing them across books, or across snapshots of one book, is only
meaningful once each quote is restated as the line it would carry at a
symmetric -110. This mirrors what ``create_df_to_predict(normalize_total_lines=True)``
already does for the closing dataset, so a line at T means the same thing as a
line in the existing training data.

The estimator is the one already in
``nba_ou.data_processing.odds.normalize_total_lines``; only ``sigma`` and the
column plumbing are market-specific. This module adds two things that module
does not provide:

1. **Vectorisation.** The existing entry points are scalar and run a
   100-iteration bisection per integer-line quote. The snapshot dataset has
   hundreds of thousands of quotes, so both branches are done over numpy arrays
   here. ``tests/test_line_history_normalization.py`` asserts this path agrees
   with the scalar original.
2. **Signed lines.** ``round_to_increment`` rejects negatives and spreads are
   signed, so rounding is done on the magnitude and the sign reapplied -- i.e.
   half-away-from-zero, which is the symmetric choice for a mirrored market.

Moneyline is deliberately *not* given a centered line: there is no line to
shift, so normalisation there means devigging only.
