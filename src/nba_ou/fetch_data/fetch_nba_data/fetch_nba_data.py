    Fetches and processes NBA game data for a specified season.

    This function retrieves game statistics from the NBA API for the given season, processes the data,
    and returns updated game and player statistics. It avoids duplicate entries by checking against
    previously fetched data.

    Args:
        season_nullable (str): The NBA season in the format 'YYYY-YY' (e.g., '2023-24').
        input_df (pd.DataFrame, optional): An existing DataFrame containing previously fetched game data.
                                           If provided, new game data will be appended, avoiding duplicates.
                                           Deprecated - use existing_game_ids instead.
        input_player_stats (pd.DataFrame, optional): An existing DataFrame containing previously fetched
                                                     player statistics. If provided, new player stats
                                                     will be appended, avoiding duplicates.
        existing_game_ids (set, optional): A set of game IDs already present in the database.
                                           If provided, only games not in this set will be fetched.
        n_tries (int, optional): The number of attempts to fetch each game's box score data in case of failures.
                                 Default is 3.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - pd.DataFrame: Updated game data including team statistics.
            - pd.DataFrame: Updated player statistics.
            - bool: Flag indicating if the rate limit was reached during data fetching.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the `season_nullable` format is incorrect.

    Notes:
        - The function avoids redundant requests by skipping games already present in `existing_game_ids` or `input_df`.
        - The function introduces a delay between API requests to prevent hitting rate limits.
        - If the rate limit is reached (299 games fetched), the function pauses for 5 seconds
          and resets the HTTP session before stopping further requests.
