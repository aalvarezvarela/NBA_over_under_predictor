# DIAGNOSTIC CAMPAIGN. Every run here carries a synthetic feature derived from
# the target. The numbers measure whether this pipeline can find a signal it is
# handed; they say nothing about live performance and no run here can be
# promoted (training_pipeline.promote refuses them by name).

# Follow along:
#   tail -f artifacts/logs/planted_signal_*.log
#
# Compare afterwards:
#   poetry run python scripts/compare_planted_signal.py
#
# Budget: the trial count deliberately matches the real campaign (200 trials x
# 30 folds), because "can 50 trials find it" is a different question from "can
# our protocol find it". That is ~24,000 fits across the four cells before
# pruning, plus 3 holdout evaluations each.
#
# To sanity-check the machinery before committing that, run the single most
# discriminating cell on its own -- it is the one whose failure would already
# answer the question:
#   poetry run python -m training_pipeline.cli \
#     experiments/diagnostics_planted_signal_2026_08/signal_020.yaml --no-save-model
# Lowering optuna.n_trials in the YAMLs also works, but answers a reduced
# question and must be said out loud when reporting the result.
