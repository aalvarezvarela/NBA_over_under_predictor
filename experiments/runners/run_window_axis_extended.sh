#
# The data regime is identical in all three (extend_history_dropping_season_gated
# _columns: true, 8,279 rows / 1,232 columns). The window is the only difference,
# which is the whole point: in public_betting_tradeoff_2026_08 the window was a
# tuned hyperparameter, the pruner killed 94 of 95 trials at the first fold it
# was allowed to act on, and the large windows ended up with 5 completed trials
# between them. See d1_window_3000.yaml for the full post-mortem.

# holdout across three seeds. Raising pruner_warmup_fraction to 0.5 roughly
# doubles the cost of a pruned trial, so expect tuning nearer 60 min per cell.
