# Why did line_error stop beating the bookmaker?
#
# Every archived line_error run beat the line on the 416-game holdout (model MAE
# 14.3332-14.4934 against a line MAE of 14.5036). Cells A and C of the
# public-betting campaign do not: 14.5186 and 14.5100, i.e. the model is now
# WORSE than doing nothing. The holdout cohort is byte-identical across the two
# eras -- same 60-day window, same 416 games, same line MAE to four decimals --
# so this is not a cohort artefact, and MAE is far less noisy than ROI, so it is
# not the seed spread either.
#
# Four things changed. Two are testable:
#
#   d_corr995_control      cleaning.corr_threshold 0.95 -> 0.995, ODDS_ override
#                          removed. Returns 150 of the 300 lost features.
#   e_test_anchored_control  rolling_origin/30/pooled -> test_anchored/12/mean.
#                          Explains the CV MAE sign flip if the folds, not the
#                          model, are what changed.
#
# Two are not. The 20260704 CSV predates the ODDS_ prefix unification and has
# zero ODDS_ columns, so it cannot be loaded by today's code at all -- and 93 of
# the 146 features it had that the new one lacks are DIFF_FROM_LINE_caesars_*,
# removed by the Caesars book merge and not coming back. n_trials (50 -> 120)
# cannot remove a feature; test it by re-reading the first 50 trials out of the
# persistent study rather than by spending another cell.
#
# READ AGAINST pubbet_a_keep_columns, which is already in
# artifacts/experiments/public_betting_tradeoff_2026_08/. The decisive number is
# holdout MAE against 14.5036, not ROI: at this bet volume ROI moves 4.5-9.3
# points on seed alone, and the archived runs' own ROI median was only +0.60%.
# Two cells against one baseline is two comparisons -- one marginal win is not
# a result. What would be: one cell moving MAE back under the line while the
# other does not.
